# Monthly_Minimal_Temperature_Time_Series_Forecasting

The dataset contains the minimum temperatures over 10 years (1981-1990) in the city Melbourne, Australia. Performed Dickey-Fuller test to ensure data is stationary and removed temporal dependency by differencing. Applied SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling to predict the coming years forecast.
